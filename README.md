# Jupyter Notebook: Molecular Analog Generator

## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook is designed to generate analogs for molecules based on Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation. It takes a SMILES string as input and provides a SMILES string as output, representing a structurally similar compound.

## Dependencies

- RDKit: A collection of cheminformatics and machine learning tools.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment for code development.

## Installation

1. Install RDKit library:
   ```
   !pip install rdkit
   ```
2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. **Input SMILES String**: Provide a valid SMILES string for the molecule you want to generate analogs for.

2. **Generate Analog**: Execute the code cell to generate analogs.

3. **Output**: The notebook will display the generated analogs as SMILES strings.
