# Molecular Batch Converter

## Introduction

Are you frequently faced with the challenge of performing batch conversions for various molecular file formats, such as Structure Data Files (SDF) to Protein Data Bank (PDB) or converting SMILES representations to AutoDock PDBQT format? If you've encountered this dilemma in your scientific or computational endeavors, worry not â€“ this repository is designed to simplify and streamline your molecular data conversion needs.

**Say goodbye to tedious, manual conversions!**

## Features

### 1. SDF to PDB Conversion

Easily convert Structure Data Files (SDF) to Protein Data Bank (PDB) format. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets of molecular structures.

### 2. SMILES to PDBQT Conversion

Effortlessly convert SMILES representations stored in an Excel sheet to AutoDock PDBQT format. This feature enables seamless integration with AutoDock for molecular docking studies.

### 3. Batch Processing

Perform conversions on hundreds or even thousands of molecular files simultaneously. The batch processing capability ensures efficiency and saves valuable time.

### 4. Interactive Jupyter Notebooks

Leverage the power of Jupyter Notebooks for a customizable and interactive conversion environment. The provided notebooks offer a user-friendly interface for performing and customizing conversions.
